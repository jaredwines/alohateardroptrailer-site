<p class="">We went to “our local spot” by the lake and unplugged for the weekend. It was incredible to be back in nature and just spend some down time together. </p><p class="">Notch recently did an article about us, how we came about creating Wander Tears, and the social media side of our business. You can check out the post <a href="https://www.get-notch.com/blog/creator-heroes-wander-tears">here</a>!</p><p class="">We are also off to our first show of any sort with one of our teardrop trailers! We are headed to the <a href="https://www.charlestonbluegrassfestival.com">Charleston Blue Grass Festival </a>March 18-19 with one of our builds. If you’re in the are be sure to stop by and say hi!</p><p class="">Lastly we are now selling our popular <a href="https://wandertears.com/merch/p/usa-galley-map">USA galley map</a> in our shop! We have been asked so many times about this map and where to buy it. We have used this map so many times during our travels as we usually decide where to go next while on a road trip. You can get your own <a href="https://wandertears.com/merch/p/usa-galley-map">here</a>!</p>

<h3>Builds </h3><p class="">We have a very exciting new piece of equipment coming soon that will help us speed up production. This means our lead time is going to decrease quite a bit and we can get more custom campers out in less time! </p><p class="">We had one custom teardrop head up to New Jersey for a family of three, another one is taking off to Florida then out for a 4 month trip at the end of the month, and we have a few currently being built! You can check out our models and all the customizations <a href="https://wandertears.com/teardrop-models">here</a>.  </p><p class="">Did you know we have a $500 US military discount off our custom builds?</p>

<h3>DIY </h3><p class="sqsrte-large">Plans</p><p class="">We love seeing DIYers building their own teardrops using our plans across the globe! When you get our detailed <a href="https://wandertears.com/diy-plans">DIY plans</a> your are also invited to our private build community on Facebook. This is where DIYers share their progress and can ask any questions related to building their teardrop. </p><p class="">Something very cool that has also come from the group is individuals from different countries sharing information on where to get materials and parts that are more difficult to find outside of the US. (Our DIY plans include links and part numbers for all materials, however some companies doing ship internationally). </p><p class="">DIY Plans are available for the <a href="https://wandertears.com/diy-plans/p/renegade">Renegade</a>, <a href="https://wandertears.com/diy-plans/p/the-vaga-series-basic-plans">Vaga</a>, and <a href="https://wandertears.com/diy-plans/p/the-hopper-4x8-plans">Hopper</a> models. We also have added a <a href="https://wandertears.com/diy-plans/p/the-vaga-3d-model-with-layers">3D Vaga model with layers</a> to our DIY page so you can easily manipulate the free 3D Vaga model to better visualize the components. (This model is included in the DIY Plans).</p><p class="">We also are working on plans for a 5’x10’ teardrop! Stay tuned if you’re looking for the extra space or have a bigger family!</p><p class="">Be sure to check out our other blog posts to see some of our featured DIYers. We also share a lot of our DIYer’s progress on Instagram in our feed and in our stories!</p>

<p class="sqsrte-large">Trailer Frames</p><p class="">One of the most important parts of your teardrop build is the trailer frame. You want a strong foundation that can take you wherever you want to wander. Unfortunately, finding a quality trailer frame can also be one of the trickiest parts of the build process. </p><p class="">Upon popular request, we now supply <a href="https://wandertears.com/trailer-frames">steel trailer frames</a> for DIYers! A few of DIYers have already picked up their frames from us for their builds, and we can’t wait to see their progress! Just like our teardrops, frames can be customized to meet your vision. From a basic frame to a fully off-road with wheels to match your vehicle.</p><p class="">All trailer frames come with a VIN, Bill of Sale, and Certificate of Origin which will make your life much easier when it comes time to register your teardrop. </p>

<p class="">Here’s what they had to say about their build so far:</p><p class=""><strong>What made you want to build a tiny camper?</strong></p><p class="">A long time ago, I saw a teardrop teamed up with a vintage truck we’d love to own. Both were on our wish list. First we bought the truck, and then 3 yrs later the trailer we’re using to build our teardrop camper.</p><p class=""><br><strong>What was your experience level with building when you started?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="">Our experience building campers was zero. We're both very handy &amp; crafty with wood working and other home projects and improvements. Always willing to learn and very teachable...<br></p><p class=""><strong>What was the first step in your build?</strong></p><p class="">Our trailer came assembled with a lumber floor. The first step was getting The Vaga Plans. Then started with the side walls which we cut using the blue print.<br></p>

<p class=""><strong>What was the most difficult part of the build?</strong></p><p class="">We found that working inside the cabin is kind of difficult due to the space limitation but always fun. We enjoy every part of the build.<br></p><p class=""><strong>How long has it taken you so far?</strong></p><p class="">So far we been working after 6pm everyday for 3 months. Still have to do the electrical components into the tounge box, charge controller, RV Battery &amp; 1500 inverter. And of course, Nancy's decoration...🤗</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class=""><strong>How did you pay for the build?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="">We been buying materials as we build. Everything done by ourself. <br></p>

<p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class=""><strong>Would you do anything differently?&nbsp;</strong><br></p><p class="">Different... We built the doors ourselves due to the high cost of the doors shipped to Puerto Rico. It was 1k just for the two doors and the shipping. Love the doors you use and I recommend to our friends in the states to use them. It’s easier too. For the rest of the components, we mostly purchased what's listed in the plans!<br><br></p><p class=""><strong>What are you most looking forward to in owning a teardrop trailer?</strong></p><p class="">Nancy doesn’t like camping, but staying in a teardrop is more comfortable and fun! Being able to just get where you’re going, park, and everything is set to start enjoying your stay.<br><br></p><p class=""><strong>Any tips for someone that wants to build a tiny camper but doesn’t know where to start?</strong></p><p class="">The right way to start is to buy the plans and join the facebook private group for tips and complete videos on how to do it. Different stages of the built are shown by the master teardrop builders. Having the plans will take you to the right timing, the right use of materials, the right tools and will avoid any waste of time and money. Everything is there. The plans are easy to understand and visually helpful.</p>

<p class="">If you frequently camp in the desert or on the coast where there aren’t a ton of trees available for hammock hanging, get her a <a href="https://amzn.to/3J6L0ul">hammock stand</a>. We purchased one from <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Ozark-Trail-128-Portable-Steel-Hammock-Stand-Grey-Color/446714067?adid=22222222277446714067_117755028669_12420145346&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAl-6PBhBCEiwAc2GOVMCeYAflU0MFBYecPaouxjSAXpmhlW_TV5W00hfJtAckkaZYyLvx6hoCz4EQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;selectedSellerId=0&amp;veh=sem_LIA&amp;wl0=&amp;wl1=g&amp;wl10=8175035&amp;wl11=local&amp;wl12=446714067&amp;wl13=6576&amp;wl13=6576&amp;wl2=c&amp;wl3=501107745824&amp;wl4=pla-293946777986&amp;wl5=9010693&amp;wl6=&amp;wl7=&amp;wl8=&amp;wl9=pla&amp;wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;wmlspartner=wmtlabs">Walmart</a> mid cross country road trip last year because I wanted to cuddle while star gazing and we only had single camp chairs.

We prioritize experiences together over any tangible gift. Packing up our teardrop for the weekend to a new destination is one of our favorite activities. Here are a few experience ideas that are sure to make the day extra memorable. (Bonus points if they are a surprise!)</p><p class=""><strong>Pack a Picnic</strong></p><p class="">Pack her favorite meal and head to your local park. Everyone loves surprises, picnics and if she’s an outdoor lover you know shell love spending time outside with you.</p><p class=""><strong>Weekend Getaway</strong></p><p class="">Valentines day falls on a Monday, which means the weekend before is the perfect time to head to a new or favorite destination together and soak in the quality time. We suggest a romanic cabin somewhere in the wood with a hot tub….</p>

<h3>US</h3><p class="">We have been busy in the shop and behind the scenes working on custom teardrops and helping our DIY community with their builds. We (especially Paige) are very much over the cold weather (classic Florida girl) and ready to get back into nature for our next trip. We haven’t scheduled anything yet but will likely take the teardrop up to our favorite local spot by the lake this month and head to the Blue Ridge Mountains in March.</p>

<p class="">Our teardrop got a little update recently. We put on some bigger tires and black wheels, and we must say, it looks damn good! We had standard trailer tires, but switched to larger Wrangler Trailer Runner A/Ts. What do you think?</p><p class=""><br><br></p><h3>Builds </h3><p class="">We have several builds in progress and are steadily adding more to the queue. Production is going well and the supply chain hasn’t thrown too may curve balls at us recently, so we’re thankful for that! Next month we are getting a new piece of equipment that’s going to speed up production quite a bit. (We’ll share more soon!) We love our Vaga model, but are excited to have a few Renegade LT and Renegade AT orders in the queue. </p><p class="">Our All Terrain (AT) models are built on a heavy duty frame and have the option to add independent suspension and a lift.

<h3>DIY </h3><p class="sqsrte-large">Plans</p><p class="">We are now helping teardrop builders across the globe! When you get our detailed <a href="https://wandertears.com/diy-plans">DIY plans</a> your are also invited to our private build community on Facebook. This is where DIYers share their progress and can ask any questions related to building their teardrop. </p><p class="">Something very cool that has also come from the group is individuals from different countries sharing information on where to get materials and parts that are more difficult to find outside of the US. (Our DIY plans include links and part numbers for all materials, however some companies doing ship internationally). </p><p class="">DIY Plans are available for the <a href="https://wandertears.com/diy-plans/p/renegade">Renegade</a>, <a href="https://wandertears.com/diy-plans/p/the-vaga-series-basic-plans">Vaga</a>, and <a href="https://wandertears.com/diy-plans/p/the-hopper-4x8-plans">Hopper</a> models. We also have added a <a href="https://wandertears.com/diy-plans/p/the-vaga-3d-model-with-layers">3D Vaga model with layers</a> to our DIY page so you can easily manipulate the free 3D Vaga model to better visualize the components. (This model is included in the DIY Plans).</p><p class="sqsrte-large">Trailer Frames</p><p class="">One of the most important parts of your teardrop build is the trailer frame. You want a strong foundation that can take you wherever you want to wander. Unfortunately, finding a quality trailer frame can also be one of the trickiest parts of the build process. </p><p class="">Upon popular request, we now supply <a href="https://wandertears.com/trailer-frames">steel trailer frames</a> for DIYers! </p><p class="">Not only will this guarantee a strong frame for you to start your build, but it comes with a VIN, Bill of Sale, and Certificate of Origin which will make your life much easier when it comes time to register your teardrop. </p>

<p class="">We asked Brad to share some insight about being a first time teardrop builder, his previous experience, and how he came across the idea to create a tiny camper of his own. Here’s what he had to say:</p><h4>What made you want to build a tiny camper?</h4><p class="">A few factors came into play when deciding to build our teardrop. We had been looking for something small to pull behind our car (towing capacity is under 2000 lbs so it needed to be compact) and Covid had me a bit stir crazy. I started looking into what it took to build a teardrop and found tons of resources and a massive community and decided it would be a great project to keep myself occupied while we were still going through lockdowns here in Canada.</p><h4>What was your experience level with woodworking, etc when you started?</h4><p class="">I would consider myself a beginner in terms of my experience with woodworking, electrical or general handy work before taking on this project. Plenty of research and learning how to use new tools throughout the process. It was extremely rewarding learning all these new skills all at once.</p>

<p class="">We are excited to feature Blanca The Teardrop and introduce you to the Bermijos! A family of four from Southern California who love to travel in their teardrop trailer.  </p><p class="">They are the perfect example of prioritizing getting into nature, spending time with the ones you love most, and having their kiddos BE the reason they travel, not prevent them from it!</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">We asked them a few questions about how they became interested in teardrop campers and what their experience has been as a family traveling in a tiny camper. Here’s what they had to say:</p><h4>What made you want a tiny camper?&nbsp;</h4><p class="">I’ve had a dream to own one for over a decade but then I kept putting it off, got busy, got married, had kids. Then 2020 happened and I realized, why am I waiting? I want to make this happen NOW. I searched and almost gave up and finally found Wander Tears who was able to check off all my boxes. Best decision ever!<br></p>

<p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><h4>What has been the best part of owning a tiny camper?</h4><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><p class="">Making memories with my family especially with my daughters who are 5 and 3. Not having to spend so much time setting up and breaking down at campsites. The comfort and galley are a huge game changer from tent camping! And of course the looks she gets everywhere we go. She’s a head-turner!</p><p class=""><br></p><h4>People are usually shocked just how spacious a tiny camper can be. What is it like to have a family of 4 in a teardrop?</h4><p class="">It’s so spacious and comfortable! It’s not as cramped as people might think. Right now my kids are little and they always find a way to pile onto our bed at home anyway. What I love about it is that you’re still forced to be outside to enjoy the outdoors. We didn’t want a trailer that would take away from that.</p>

<h4>Tell us about the cot and how you came up with that idea.</h4><p class="">I stumbled upon a photo of a cot in a teardrop and immediately asked Danny if we could make it happen. I’m so glad he was able to find space for it. This made the camper so much more functional for us and added years of use. We chose a cot vs. a permanent bunk so that it could be rolled away when we’re not using it or if the kids aren’t with us!</p>

<p class="sqsrte-large">Let’s talk trailer frames + chassis.</p><p class="">Your frame is the foundation of your teardrop build. There are three main options for a trailer chassis:</p><p class="">A) Weld it (or <a href="https://wandertears.com/trailer-frames">purchase a welded frame</a>)</p><p class="">B) <a href="https://amzn.to/3omsUfX">Ironton</a> from Northern Tool (or something similar)</p><p class="">C) Find a used trailer</p><p class=""><br></p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Weld it</strong></p><p class="">This allows you to get EXACTLY what you want. We had our first chassis welded locally and were able to give specific dimensions, making later steps in the build easier (like attaching the floor) and making sure our weight distribution was on point. </p><p class="">We now weld our own frames using 2”x2” 11 gauge (.120) tubing.</p><p class="">You can find the specific schematics for our frames in our <a href="https://wandertears.com/diy-plans">DIY Plans.</a></p><p class="">Over the past few months we had more and more DIYers reaching out to us for a quality trailer frame to purchase for their builds. Upon popular demand, we now supply DIYers with steel trailer frames for their builds! You can check out the options <a href="https://wandertears.com/trailer-frames">here</a>.</p><p class=""><br></p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Ironton</strong></p><p class="">For the Renegade we decided to use the <a href="https://amzn.to/3kIDls2">Ironton 5x8 trailer frame from Northern Tool</a>. It is lightweight, simple to put together, and budget friendly ($619.99USD). </p><p class="">We are extremely impressed by the off-road ability of this thing! Paige’s sister and her fiancé took it across the US on just about every terrain, including some rock crawling in Utah.</p><p class="">However, there were a few modifications we made to make it work for a teardrop design:</p><p class=""> 1. Move the axle aft 4-7 inches. Since the galley carries most of the weight its necessary to move the axle back and drill new holes for the axle hangers. Skipping this step will cause the tongue weight will be nearly zero. This is a bad thing. You want about 10% of the weight to be on the tongue.</p><p class="">2. Welding crucial joints in the chassis, opposed to only using bolts. This step is not necessary if you do not have access to a welder but will add some durability. </p><p class="">3. Swapping 12” wheels for 15” wheels. You will need to add 2” spacers to the hubs. We highly recommend this. It will tow better, look better, and be more functional on the backroads. And let’s be honest, if you don’t plan on taking this on some dusty backroads, what’s the point? </p>

<p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>Used Trailer</strong></p><p class="">A popular place to find an affordable chassis to build upon is Facebook marketplace, or similar online forum. </p><p class="">You may be able to find an Ironton trailer frame at a great discount as well. </p><p class="">Be sure to inspect it thoroughly. You need to be comfortable with the condition of any used trailer frame, and if it needs repairs, you need to be able to do the work. </p><p class="">If you go this route you may run into issues with the axle location. Just like with the Ironton, standard axles will be located 60% of the way back on the trailer frame. 60% x 96” equals 57.6”. We recommend placing the axle at 60-62” from the front. </p><p class="">Avoiding this step may make the trailer unstable while driving. Look up “imbalanced trailer” to see what we mean. You may get around it by adding extra weight to the tongue with a tongue box. </p><p class=""><br></p><p class="sqsrte-large"><strong>So, which option will you go with?</strong></p><p class=""><br></p><p class=""><a href="https://wandertears.com/trailer-frames">Purchase a trailer frame for your DIY Teardrop from Wander Tears.</a></p><p class=""><em>For trailer frame schematics and more teardrop build details, shop our </em><a href="https://wandertears.com/diy-plans"><em>DIY Plans.</em></a></p>

With a little preparation and the right mindset, going <strong>“green”</strong> is pretty easily obtainable, no matter where you are.</p><p class="">We put together a list of tips and tricks we like to use while traveling in our teardrop camper trailer that keeps us on the right track towards a sustainable camping trip.</p><h3>Reduce. Reuse. Recycle.</h3><p class="">A simple saying that has been around for what seems like forever, and the perfect place to start.</p><p class="">Reducing the waste you create and add to the trash piling up on earth is SO important! By using products more than once and opting for items sustainably sourced, you are doing just that. </p><p class="">Get ready, because there are so many ways to get started!</p><h2>1. Reusable Products</h2><p class="">One of the best ways to reduce the waste you produce is by <strong>opting for reusable products</strong>. Switching to just a few of these eco-friendly options can have an enormous impact!</p><h3>Water Bottles</h3><p class="">We always have our <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083GBV7M5/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B083GBV7M5&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wandertears00-20&amp;linkId=522a954339ebd25d91ff2c297e34bbd3" target="_blank">hydro flask</a> bottles with us on the road. </p><p class="">Not only does using reusable water bottles eliminate single-use plastic, but insulated bottles keep your water icy cold for the whole day! (And there’s nothing better than ice water in the desert sun). </p><p class="">While hiking we opt for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071DQSZB8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B071DQSZB8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wandertears00-20&amp;linkId=3b047d6fc863ca839a50b3d89f63ae9d" target="_blank">bladders</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004H8BIKW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B004H8BIKW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wandertears00-20&amp;linkId=b2aa543fd75094448f9fbd9b1de82ed3" target="_blank">Nalgene</a> bottles to cut back on weight.

<h3>Grocery Bags</h3><p class="">Just like at home, we keep a couple of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H7JCD6J/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B07H7JCD6J&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wandertears00-20&amp;linkId=5abbd8835f89f21e245acaf297781181" target="_blank">reusable grocery bags</a> handy for trips to the supermarket. Or if you’re only getting a couple of items at the convenience store, opt for no bag at all.</p>

<h3>The average American family takes home roughly 1,500 plastic shopping bags a year!</h3>

Additionally, discarded paper towels result in 254 million tons of trash globally, every year.</p><p class="">Who wants to save some trees with us?!</p><p class="">(Plus, quick-dry cloths are more compact than paper towel rolls).</p><h3>Rechargeable Items</h3><p class=""><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZNNQ9Z7/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B07ZNNQ9Z7&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wandertears00-20&amp;linkId=404cca0e226f2263cff61334fd861408" target="_blank">Headlamps</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Y1JZH4Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B07Y1JZH4Y&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wandertears00-20&amp;linkId=a88261f9df8b32792077d4bff767f932" target="_blank">flashlights</a> are the first things that come to mind. </p><p class="">And it is so nice to be able to plug them in for a couple of hours and not have to worry about bringing along extra batteries.</p><p class="">However, if you have a battery-powered headlamp that you LOVE, opt for rechargeable batteries.</p><p class="">There are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FDXDB3W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B07FDXDB3W&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wandertears00-20&amp;linkId=1225113e9be6dac4c32d10c1710a220b" target="_blank">solar-powered chargers</a> for both options, so you won’t even need to use your camper's battery! Just the trusty sun.</p><p class="">We also have a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01L4WHOY2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B01L4WHOY2&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wandertears00-20&amp;linkId=838468c0e4654d15f0e6c9ee1bdb0e54" target="_blank">solar-powered lamp</a> that keeps camp illuminated and is 100% earth-friendly! We simply put it in a sunny area when we’ve found our spot for the night and its ready by sundown.</p><h2>2. Recycle</h2><p class="">It's inevitable that you will obtain <em>some</em> waste, even if you try to minimize what you use.</p><p class="">Make sure to dispose of everything properly, and opt for recyclable packaging when available. Such as choosing boxed water over bottled.</p><p class="">While on the road you may need to hang on to your recyclables longer than you would at home, but it is worth it to keep them from ending up in the landfill.</p><p class="">A quick google search can help you find the nearest recycling center to you. Make sure to check the operating hours before you make the trip!</p><h2>3. Conserve Water</h2><h3>One-Pot Meals</h3><p class="">You may be wondering how cooking a meal can make you more sustainable.</p><p class="">If you only use a single pot, you will have fewer dishes and therefore require less water for cleanup. </p><p class="">Less cleanup means more time to relax!</p><p class="">And if you're anything like Danny, you'll reduce your cleanup further by eating straight from the pot!</p>

<h3>Dirty Dishes Bin</h3><p class="">This was a game-changer for us. Before we found the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XP9RHH1/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B07XP9RHH1&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wandertears00-20&amp;linkId=c3bc1e57c56198490b6048590d0902ce" target="_blank">collapsible bin</a> we use now, we would try to dump soapy water from bowl to bowl in order to conserve it.</p><p class="">Having a reservoir makes life so much easier and uses WAY less water to get the job done!</p><p class="">Check the camping isles in Wal-Mart for a decent, collapsible sink. There are even <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WT4B1XK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B07WT4B1XK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wandertears00-20&amp;linkId=c64bb17bea689c0ea0185b7442e3a572" target="_blank">some options </a>with a built-in cutting board. This is what space-savers dream of!</p><h2>4. Borrow, Share, Rent</h2><p class="">If you’re setting out for your first trip, whether it’s camping, backpacking, hiking, or anything in between, try to borrow or rent gear before diving headfirst and purchasing.</p><p class="">We have accumulated gear overtime that we absolutely LOVE. However in the process, we found some items and brands that we either didn’t really need or found alternatives we liked better.</p><p class="">When you do go to buy, explore used items first. Not only is this the Green choice, but you’ll usually save a ton of money! One of our favorite things is to go to REI Garage Sales to find used gear that still has a lot of life left. Find out when the next REI Garage Sale is nearest to you <a href="https://www.rei.com/events/86150/members-only-garage-sale" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p class="">After you do buy, if anything breaks, try to fix it! Don’t go throwing away perfectly good gear due to a tear or ailment. There are plenty of companies, local and nation wide, that can fix most things.</p><h2>5. Leave no trace</h2><h3>Stick to the Trail</h3><p class="">Off-trail trekking can cause erosion and harm to native vegetation. While it may be very enticing, do your best to stay on marked paths, especially if the sediment is soft or loose.</p><p class="">Additionally, choosing soft sole shoes will reduce your literal footprints on the environment.</p>

<h3>Resist the Urge to Build Cairns</h3><p class="">Not only are cairns used by rangers to mark trails, but creating them can disrupt the natural environment. </p><p class="">It doesn’t seem like stacking a few rocks makes a huge difference, but it can gradually lead to more extreme disruptions and the relocation of larger rocks. Not to mention the misdirection of your fellow hikers.</p><h3>Litter is Bad</h3><p class="">Okay. That statement is probably quite obvious for most people. </p><h3><em>But don’t litter! </em></h3><p class="">Even “biodegradable” items like fruit peels, nutshells, and apple cores. These things can take much longer to degrade than you expect. Did you know it takes a banana peel to <strong>TWO YEARS</strong> to decompose? </p><p class="">Additionally, this can disrupt the natural instincts of animals and cause them to eat something that may not be good for them. Or lead them to more dangerous areas, such as close to busy roads.</p><p class="">Also, try to pick up litter, even if it is not yours. Rather than stepping over a wrapper, pack it out! </p><p class="">This goes for anything you pack in as well, including toilet paper...</p><h3>Human Waste</h3><p class="">If you’ve got to go, you’ve got to go. But please make sure no one else has to know that you went. </p><p class="">Always dig a hole at least 6 inches deep, 200 meters from a water source, and bury it back up when you’re finished. The heal of your boot makes for a nice shovel alternative if you do not have one on hand.</p><p class="">Remember to bring a bag to pack out your trash, <em>including toilet paper</em>. </p><p class="">Ideally don’t use a clear bag, because, well, you know.</p><h3>Gray Water Disposal</h3><p class="">It’s certain that you will accumulate some waste water while camping.</p><p class=""> After doing dishes or washing clothes, dispose of your water in a dry area away from natural water sources as to not contaminate anything.</p><h2>6. Choose Eco Friendly, Biodegradable and Toxic-Free Products</h2><p class="">Not only are these products healthier for the environment than their chemical-filled counterparts, but they are typically better for you!</p><p class="">Switching to biodegradable products is <em>crazy </em>easy, and is vital for a sustainable camping trip.</p><h3>Bug Repellant</h3><p class="">I don’t know about you, but mosquitoes <strong>LOVE</strong> my blood. If there is one in the area, it is biting me. </p><p class=""><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CBYNGWW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00CBYNGWW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wandertears00-20&amp;linkId=f9475243a8fe5546dff6a9b5dcf7d4f6" target="_blank">Bug sprays </a>with essential oils work great, and often smell great too! Whatever you do, try to stay away from those with deet.</p><p class="">When you’re at your campsite, opt for a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075SDFNX6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B075SDFNX6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wandertears00-20&amp;linkId=5ea1673fd595d390ff621792545a6719" target="_blank">bug repellent lantern</a>. They often don’t use any chemicals and you will be shielded from the little enemies. </p>
